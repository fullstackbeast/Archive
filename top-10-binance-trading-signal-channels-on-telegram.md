The use of Binance signals groups to help traders/investors determine profitable investments is becoming more and more prevalent. With the prices of a majority of cryptocurrencies either stagnating or declining in value, trying to find the correct trade has become increasingly difficult. However, following trading signals may be a lucrative solution to this very difficult problem if traders are willing to take the gamble and explore this relatively new niche within the cryptocurrency community.

This article will take a look at the 10 best Binance signals groups on Telegram, and why choosing the correct provider to follow will be instrumental in determining If you are able to generate a return or not.

For those who do not know what trading signals are, here's a quick introduction.

### What are Trading Signals?

Trading signals are instructions sent directly to an individual telling them which cryptocurrency to buy. A typical signal would contain the following information:

* The cryptocurrency to buy -- The signal will specify which cryptocurrency that should be bought, e.g. BTC, ETH, XRP.
* The buy-in price -- The price you should try to buy the cryptocurrency at
* The sell-targets -- The price you should sell the cryptocurrency at in order to achieve a profit
* Stop losses -- A mechanism to automatically exit your position to mitigate losses

![Binance Trading Signal - Example](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Binance-Signal.png)

Typically, traders may not achieve the ideal buy-in price, which is why you may see providers give a range. For example, instead of specifying a buy-in price of $8500 per bitcoin, a signal provider will provide a range of $8500 -- $8600 per bitcoin. This gives traders plenty of scope to try and achieve the correct buy-in price as this would affect their resulting profit.

The sell-targets, or profit-targets, are the price point traders should look to exit the trade. Typically, signal providers give 3 sell-targets, all of which you should be notified by your provider if any are hit.

The stop loss is a mechanism that allows you to automatically exit a trade in order to mitigate losses. A stop loss is standard practice that any good signal provider should be using.

If all goes well and the the signal provider is trustworthy, you should hopefully make a nice profit:

Trading signals are cryptocurrency exchange specific. For example, Binance signals are trading signals that can only be followed if you wish to place a trade on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. However, there exists other trading signals that are specific to other crypto exchanges such as: BitMex and Coinbase.

Now that you understand what trading signals are and how profitable they can be, we can now get onto the 10 best Binance signals groups on Telegram.

### Binance Signals: Spot Vs. Leveraged Trading

Now that you have a complete list of all the top crypto Binance signals groups on telegram, it's also important to understand that there are two different types of trading that can supported on Binance -- spot and leverage trading.

Each has their own pros and cons, and an important question to ask a channel admin when looking to join a Binance trading signal group is which type they support. I'll give a quick description of what both are along with their respective advantages and disadvantages.

Spot Trading

![Binance Logo](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Binance-Logo-2.png)

Spot trading of Bitcoin is characterized by the purchase and immediate delivery of the asset itself. Most people when they say they want to buy Bitcoin will be referring to spot trading. It is the most common way of getting exposure to the asset class.

To illustrate, consider the following example: Alice opens a Coinbase account and wishes to use $1000 of her money to buy Bitcoin. With a current trading price of $10,000 for 1 BTC, Alice's $1000 gets her exactly 0.1 BTC in her wallet.

The price of Bitcoin increase to $11,000, making Alice's 0.1 BTC now worth $1100\. Using her Coinbase account, she decides to sell her bitcoin yielding a nice return of $100\.

This method of using fiat gateways such as Coinbase to purchase a cryptocurrency is spot trading. It is the most common type of trading that new investors will engage in and is less risky when compared to its counterpart of leveraged trading.

A key thing to note about spot trading is that you can only bet that the price of the cryptocurrency you've purchased will go up, this is also known as going long. Whereas leverage trading allows you to both bet the price of an asset will go up as well as down (going short).

Typically this may not be an issue for most investors, however, when Bitcoin enters periods of decline, or also known as bear markets, then only being able to take long positions makes it a difficult asset to trade.

Leveraged Trading

![Binance Trading Signal - Futures](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Binance_Futures_Logo.png)

Leveraged trading is the opposite of spot trading in that instead of directly buying and selling Bitcoin, you are instead buying and selling a representation of Bitcoin in the form of a futures contract, to be more specific, a perpetual contract.

Perpetual contracts are a type of futures contract in that they are simply an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. What make perpetual contracts special is that they do not have an expiry date and so can be held for an indefinite amount of time.

The key thing to note here is, when you're buying and selling contracts on Binance, you are not _directly _buying and selling bitcoin itself, but instead, a representation of it in the form of a contract.

There are a few advantages of being able to leverage trade, but the key ones to note are: being able to go short and being able to use leverage.

I'll further explain the differences between being able to go long and short as well as being able to use Leverage.

### Binance Signals: Going Long & Short![Long_Short](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Long_Short.jpg)Illustration of going long and going short.

Going long is the process of speculating that the price of a cryptocurrency will increase, which is in contrast to going short, wherein you are speculating that the price of a cryptocurrency will decrease.

The process of longing can be summarized as follows: buying a cryptocurrency at a specific price, the price of a cryptocurrency increases, then selling the cryptocurrency at its new increased price and making a return.

_For example, say the price of Bitcoin was currently trading at $10,000 and you decide to buy 1 BTC; this makes your purchase price $10,000\. Now, if the price of Bitcoin were to increase to $11,000 and you sell, this would result in a 10% return, yielding a $1,000 profit minus any trading fees. This process is known as going long on a cryptocurrency and is the primary method in which many new traders tend to invest._

This is in contrast to the process of going short on cryptocurrency which can be summarized as follows:

_Borrowing a cryptocurrency from a willing lender that is then immediately sold at market price, the price of the cryptocurrency then declines, the cryptocurrency is then repurchased at a lower cost then returned to the borrower. To illustrate, Bob borrows 1 BTC from Amy which he then immediately sells at market price of $10,000\. The price of 1 BTC then falls to a price of $8,000 at which point Bob buys back the 1 BTC then returns it back to Amy. The net result of this is a $2,000 profit for Bob minus any trading fees._

A tool that most advanced investors will use in order to amplify the returns that they are able to achieve with their trades is through the use of leverage. Using this tool can be incredibly lucrative but can also lead to ruin if not used carefully.

I'll give a further description of leverage in the next section below.

### Leverage![Leverage](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Leverage.png)How leverage can increase your trading power.

An investor can use leverage in order to trade as if he or she had larger amounts of capital than they actually do. For example, say you wanted to buy $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, but you only have $1,000\. Through the use of leverage, this trade would still possible.

If you selected leverage at a ratio of 1:10, then in order to purchase $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, you would only need to put up $1,000 as margin. This margin amount is used to cover any potential losses, however, you are now able to trade as if you owned $10,000 worth of Bitcoin from just $1,000\.

Binance Futures offers leverage from as little as 5x all the way up to as much as 125x. It should go without saying that the higher the leverage an investor uses, the higher the risk. This is because the liquidation price, the price at which an investor loses their entire account balance, becomes tighter. However, higher leverage also means that an investor stands to gain a significant amount of money if traded correctly. As a result, it is up to the investor to strike a balance between risk and reward.

Moving on, while we are on the topic of leverage, it's important to highlight that there are two types of leverage that a trader must be aware of, namely cross and isolated leverage.

### Binance Signals: Cross & Isolated Leverage![Image showing cross and isolated leverage](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cross_Isolated_Leverage-e1590406097206.png)Cross and Isolated Leverage

Isolated leverage is the initial capital required to open a position. One of the key advantages of isolated leverage is that you can know the exact amount you are risking. This has the distinct advantage of limiting potential losses as you can only lose the amount you have used in the trade itself. Examples of isolated leverage would simply be leverage ratios such as, 1:2, 1:10 etc. All these ratios require a specific amount of margin in order to open the position in the first place. It is isolated leverage that most new investors will find themselves using. It is the less risky of the two types of leverage, and as such, should predominantly be used by those who are still new to the concept. Conversely, cross leverage is a tool that allows a trader to use their entire account balance as margin for an open positions in order to further prevent the risk of liquidation.

To illustrate the differences between both forms of leverage, consider the following example. Alice has an account balance of 1 BTC and decides to open a long position using isolated leverage. To do this, she uses 0.1 BTC as margin for the trade, therefore leaving 0.9 BTC in her account balance and also limiting her total potential losses to 0.1 BTC. This is to say that her losses will be _isolated _to her margin.

This is in contrast to cross leverage which would require Alice's _entire _account balance of 1 BTC to act as margin in order for the trade to be opened. This therefore means that Alice's potential losses is her entire account balance of 1 BTC.

This is why cross leverage is significantly more risky that isolated leverage and should only be used if you know what you are doing. However, the real question that must then be asked is: why would anyone ever use cross leverage? The answer is liquidation price.

Using an account balance of 1 BTC to act as margin for a trade, versus using 0.1 BTC results in that trade having a much wider liquidation price. This would mean that you have more room for a trade to against you without risking liquidation.

It therefore requires a trader to be very confident of a trade for them to risk using cross leverage. However, if used correctly it also means that he or she stands to make a significant sum if they bet correctly.

### Conclusion

To conclude, trading signals are a lucrative way of generating returns in what recently has been a tough investing climate for crypto. Signal providers tend to release signals relating to a specific cryptocurrency exchange such as: Binance, BitMex and Bittrex. This list has taken a look at the top 10 Binance trading signal groups on telegram. You can find out more on these providers by joining their telegram channel.

It is also important to understand the key differences between spot and leveraging trading as well as the concepts that come along with it such as: leverage, going long or short etc.

You should only join a signal group that practices correct risk management as the results can be disastrous if done incorrectly. It is up to you as an investor to strike the fine balance between risk and reward, however, it can certainly be done.

If done correctly, then the investor can stand to make attractive capital gains on a consistent basis. We hope this article has left you better informed regarding not only the best Binance signal groups in the cryptocurrency space, but also the key trading concepts that come along with trading such a volatile asset like Bitcoin.
