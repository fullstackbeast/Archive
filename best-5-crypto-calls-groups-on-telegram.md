Trading Bitcoin is by far one of the most profitable activities that you could get involved in when joining the crypto community. Bitcoin's volatility is often thought of as being bad, but for traders this is the complete opposite. The volatile nature of Bitcoin provides plenty of opportunity to generate returns when compared to less volatile traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds. Despite this however, trading Bitcoin can be difficult because successfully trading this digital asset does pretty much require you to pay constant attention to the trading charts. As a result, we have seen the appearance of crypto calls groups on telegram, which are essentially groups of experienced traders that will tell you exactly when to buy and sell Bitcoin to generate a profit.

The key advantage of joining a crypto calls group is that these skilled traders will constantly monitor and analyse the charts to spot profitable trading opportunities so that you don't have to. If you can join a reliable and profitable crypto calls group, you will be able to grow your money passively.

If you don't know what crypto calls are (also known as [crypto trading signals](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/crypto-trading-signals-an-ultimates-beginners-guide/)), then here's a quick rundown

### What are Crypto Calls?

As you've probably already figured out, crypto calls are a set of instructions that are sent to you telling you when to buy or sell a cryptocurrency. For example, you could join a crypto calls group on telegram that sent you instructions telling you when to buy and sell Bitcoin.

Crypto calls will usually be formatted like this:

-   Cryptocurrency -- the call will tell you which cryptocurrency to buy e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum.
-   Buy -- the call will also specify the price at which you should buy the cryptocurrency
-   Sell -- of course the crypto call will tell you when to sell so that you can lock in some profits
-   Stop Loss -- the call will also specify a stop loss, so that you can be protected from any major losses.

Crypto calls will also have additional information such as the cryptocurrency that the call is intended for, and the amount that you should be allocating to the trade.

If you've joined a consistent and reliable crypto calls group, you should (hopefully!) be receiving plenty of notifications like the image shown below. These notifications highlight the amount of money you've made on the call and how long it took to make that money.

It might first seem difficult to understand what you've just read, but it is quite straightforward. A lot of the work that goes into following crypto calls is handled automatically by bots on Telegram. The advantage of these bots is that they will allow you to follow the crypto calls automatically.

Now that we've covered what exactly crypto calls are let's now take a look at the best telegram groups that you should be joining so that you can start receiving profitable and consistent crypto calls.
