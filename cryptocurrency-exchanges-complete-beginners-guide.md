So you've learned about cryptocurrency, perhaps due to news coverage on the incredible market growth that has occurred in the space, or you are fascinated by the underlying technology underpinning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Whatever it is, the first thing that most people want to do after hearing, and understanding a little about cryptocurrency, is how to buy it. This can be done by using what are known as cryptocurrency exchanges. A cryptocurrency exchange is simply an online platform that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency. There are quite a lot of exchanges out there, so before you choose an exchange to trade cryptocurrencies, you should consider a few things first.

### Factors to Consider when Choosing an Exchange

* Reputation -- Cryptocurrency is a very new and exciting area to be apart of, however, this can also bring some problems. There are bad actors within the space that will try and take advantage of you. That is why reputation in this nascent industry is very important. Only trade on cryptocurrency exchanges that are well known and have a good track record in the industry. You can utilize user reviews and public forums such as Reddit to get a sense of how trustworthy an exchange is.
* Trading Fees -- If you are going to be buying and selling various cryptocurrencies actively, then it is vital that you look at a cryptocurrency exchange's fee structure. The lower the trading fees, the more profitable your trades can be. Exchanges may also charge a deposit fee and withdrawal fee, so make sure that you are aware of what those fees may be before committing to any exchange.
* Verification Requirement -- Some cryptocurrency exchanges will also require that you verify your personal identity in order to make deposits and withdrawals. A passport or drivers licence is normally required as part of the verification process.
* Fiat Trading Pairs -- Make sure to also check the fiat currency pairs that are supported on a cryptocurrency exchange. Some exchanges may support currency pairs such as USD, EUR, and GBP.
* Cryptocurrency Pairs -- For some exchanges, it is not possible to use fiat currencies to purchase cryptocurrencies, instead, users will have to use liquid cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. For example, a cryptocurrency pairing of BTC/ETH indicates that Ether can be purchased using Bitcoin.
* Liquidity -- It is important to make sure that an exchange has sufficient liquidity before you attempt any trades. If you place a buy or sell order for example, you may find yourself waiting hours or even days before an order can be filled. Popular exchanges will tend to have high liquidity, whereas the less popular exchanges may suffer from liquidity issues.

Now that we have covered some of the things you should be taking into consideration before using an exchange, here are some of the more popular cryptocurrency exchanges that are currently operating in the space.
