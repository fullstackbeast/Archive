The most common way most people get to know about cryptocurrency is through Bitcoin's price action. We can all remember the amount of buzz that Bitcoin generated when it almost hit the $20,000 mark at the end of 2017. The volatility of Bitcoin is great for traders, as the potential returns that can be made are much higher than in traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds. However, the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin's price movements means that it can be very difficult to trade, as you pretty much have to be paying attention to trading charts 24/7. Because of this we are seeing the emergence of daily crypto signals on telegram, which are groups of knowledgeable and experienced traders that will tell you exactly when to trade.

The main benefit of these daily signals groups is that these knowledgeable traders will dedicate all of their time to spotting profitable trade opportunities, which means that you don't have to. This is very attractive, because these groups could potentially allow you to grow your money passively.

If you don't quite know what [crypto trading signals](https://www.bestcryptooptions.com/posts/crypto-trading-signals-an-ultimates-beginners-guide/) are, then let's quickly run through exactly what they are.

### What are Daily Crypto Signals?

First of all, crypto signals are simply a set of trading instructions that are sent to you that will tell you exactly when to buy or sell a particular cryptocurrency. You can have different crypto signals groups on telegram that will trade different cryptocurrencies. For example, there are a lot of [bitcoin signals groups on telegram](https://www.bestcryptooptions.com/posts/5-best-bitcoin-signals-groups-on-telegram/) that you can join.

Daily crypto signals are trading signals that are sent out every day. Different signals groups will be different in how many signals they send out per week, so it's important that you ask before joining any signal group.

Daily crypto signals will usually be sent out in the following format:

-   Cryptocurrency -- you will be told which cryptocurrency to buy. As I mentioned before, signal groups will send out signals for a variety of cryptocurrencies, for example, [Ethereum signals](https://www.bestcryptooptions.com/posts/5-best-ethereum-signals-groups-on-telegram/).
-   Buy -- you will be told at what price you should buy the cryptocurrency (known as the entry price).
-   Sell -- you will also be told when to sell your cryptocurrency to make a profit (known as the take-profit target).
-   Stop Loss -- you should also be told the price at which you should set your stop loss in case the trade goes against you. This will help to reduce any losses.

If we take a look at the image above, we can see what daily crypto signals will like. The signal also gives us additional information, for example, the cryptocurrency exchange that you should be placing the trade on and also how much of your funds you should invest in your trade.

Now, hopefully you will join a group that sends out high quality daily crypto signals and you will begin making a consistent profit. If so, you will start getting alerts like the one below. As you can see, these alerts show you the amount of profit that you've made on the trade, and how long it took to hit that profit figure.

Now, my explanation above of crypto signals might look complicated, but in practice it's quite straightforward. A lot of the work is handled by bots on Telegram. For example, the bots allow you to follow trades automatically by simply clicking a button. If you take a look at the image below, we can see this in action. By selecting 'One Click Follow', a trade will automatically be placed on the user's behalf, which is great for simplifying the process of following trade signals.
