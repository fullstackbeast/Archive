The use of [crypto signals](https://www.bestcryptooptions.com/posts/crypto-trading-signals-an-ultimates-beginners-guide/) has exploded in popularity, as traders in the market compete to gain an edge in this volatile market. The advantage of using crypto signals is obvious, a team of dedicate traders who spend their entire time spotting profitable trading opportunities so that you don't have to. As the popularity of crypto signals grow, so to have the use of crypto signal auto traders. In this review we will take a look at the 5 best crypto signal auto traders for BitMEX and Binance Futures.

Before getting into the review, some of you might not know exactly what crypto trading signals are, so let's have a quick run through.

### What are Crypto Signals?

Crypto signals are nothing more than a set of instructions that are sent to you electronically telling you exactly how to trade (i.e. when to buy and sell crypto). So, you could quite easily join a [crypto signals group on telegram](https://www.bestcryptooptions.com/posts/the-best-crypto-signals-groups-on-telegram/) that sent you instructions telling you how to trade Bitcoin.

Usually, crypto signals are usually sent in the following format:

-   Cryptocurrency -- signals will typically contain information telling you which cryptocurrency to buy e.g. BTC or ETH
-   Buy -- a target buy price, telling you when you should enter a trade
-   Sell -- a target sell price, telling you when you should exit the trade
-   Stop Loss -- a target stop loss price, to mitigate losses in case the trade does not end up going in the right direction

There is also additional information contained in crypto signals such as: the exchange that you should be placing your trade on and the percentage of your funds that you should be investing into the trade.

If you can join a reliable and trustworthy crypto signals provider, then you'll also be receiving plenty of profit notifications like the image below shows. In these notifications you will be able to see how much you made on the trade and time frame it took to make those profits.

Most of what we've just gone through is handled automatically by bots (auto traders) on Telegram, making it very easy to follow signals automatically.

### Crypto Signal Auto Traders

As we mentioned above, crypto signal auto traders make it extremely simple for you to follow trade signals, as trades can be placed automatically for you. This is can be far better than following crypto signals manually because of two primary reasons.

Firstly, the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, so trade opportunities can pretty much present itself at any time. This trade opportunity could be at a time when you are unable to follow a crypto signal, perhaps because you are at work or asleep.

Secondly, trade execution is a really important part of cryptocurrency trading. You might make a mistake in entering and exiting your position, which may result in reduced gains or worse, a loss.

Crypto signal auto traders solve these problems because trades are placed automatically on your behalf, meaning that you can be at work or asleep and still make money. This is a great set-up because if you join a reliable and consistent crypto signal group, you will effectively be able to make money passively. Crypto signal auto traders also greatly improve trade execution, as you are able to specify your buy and sell targets before even entering into the trade, which will make your trading much more precise.

### How to setup a BitMEX and Binance Futures Auto trader

The setup for a Bitmex and Binance Futures auto trader will differ slightly depending on the bot that you decide to use. However, the setup process will largely be the same across the board. For example, pretty much all bots will require that an API (application programming interface) connection be established in order for the auto traders to be able to follow signals automatically. An API connection between your BitMEX and Binance Futures account and a crypto auto trader is likely going to be established using API keys. API keys are basically what gives the auto trader bot controls over your account to allow you to follow signals automatically. This control can be removed at any time, meaning that you are always ultimately in control.

To use Binance Futures as an example, the process of establishing an API connection between a Binance Futures account and an auto trader would be the following (this process will largely be the same across different crypto signal auto traders).

### 1\. Generate your API keys

To establish an API connection with your auto trader, the bot will likely ask for the API keys to your trading account. This will mean having to generate API keys for your account.

If you are on Binance, then you can generate your API keys by first navigating to the 'API management' section of your Binance account (see the image below).

You should then see this image

![](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-9-300x147.png)

Make sure 'enable futures' is ticked! you will need to first click on 'edit restrictions' in order to tick the 'enable futures' box.

Also, make sure: enable trading, read only, and unrestricted is ticked.

It's important you make your Binance Futures account BEFORE generating your API keys

You should then have both the API key and the secret key, which you will need to connect the crypto signal auto trader to your bot.

Now you might be on a different exchange, for example BitMEX, which in that case may require you to take slightly different steps However, the overall objective of needing to generate API keys is the same regardless of your cryptocurrency exchange.

Once the crypto signal auto trader is connected to your exchange, you will now be able to follow signals automatically. You will also be able to execute trades a lot more easily, as you will be able to set a buy and sell price before entering a position. This is much easier than manually placing buy and sell orders on your exchange, as you could make mistakes with trade execution.

Now, let's take a look at some popular crypto signal auto traders for BitMEX and Binance Futures.
