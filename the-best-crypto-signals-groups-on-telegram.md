### What Exactly Are Crypto Signals?

At a very basic level, crypto signals are simply a set of trading instructions that tell you when to buy and sell a cryptocurrency. For example, if you are receiving [bitcoin signals](https://www.bestcryptooptions.com/posts/5-best-bitcoin-signals-groups-on-telegram/) from a signals group on Telegram, their trade signals will tell you exactly when to buy and sell bitcoin.

Some of the best crypto signals group on Telegram will format their signals in the following way:

* Cryptocurrency -- you will be told exactly which cryptocurrency you should be buying, for example bitcoin or ethereum
* Buy -- you will be told exactly the price you should be buying
* Sell -- you will also be told when to sell/exit your position so that you can lock in some profits
* Stop Loss -- Finally, you will also be told the stop loss of the trade, so that you know when to exit the position if the trade doesn't quite go correctly

The best crypto signals groups predominantly operate in Telegram groups with hundreds of members. When the signal provider is ready to issue a trade, they'll send out a notification that looks like this:

![Best Crypto Signals](https://bestcryptooptions.com/img/long.png)

The call in this example are for people who trade on BitMex. The call tells you, what cryptocurrency to buy, whether to go short or long, along with the take profit targets, stop loss target and leverage amount.

If you have a good crypto signal provider that knows what they're doing, then you should hopefully make an excellent return:

### Best Crypto Signals: What is Leverage Trading?

The best crypto signals group will also often trade with leverage, so it's important to understand what this is. Crypto signals groups will use leverage trading because it allows you to make a lot more money than you would be able to with regular spot trading, where it is not possible to trade with leverage. For those that do not fully understand what leverage trading is, let's take a deep dive into this area.

Now, it's likely that when you first bought you first cryptocurrency, you did it with a regular spot trading account. So, you likely used your own funds to buy your first crypto. However, buying with leverage allows you to use your owns funds on your account balance plus borrowed funds to purchase crypto. Because you can use borrowed funds to purchase the cryptocurrecy, you will actually be able to buy more crypto.

From a trading perspective this is great, because if you can buy more cryptocurrency, you can generate a higher return because you are holding more crypto, so your profits are amplified. Some of the best crypto signals groups in the space and traders in general, are increasing the use of leverage due to the higher gains that can be captured with the use of leverage.

Another related concept to leverage that you need to understand is margin. At a basic level, margin is just the amount of funds that needs to be in your trading account to cover any potential losses that you might make. In order to first trade with leverage, you will need to have sufficient margin that will serve as collateral for that leverage trade.

For example, if Alice wished to buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin, but she could only afford to have $1,000 in her trading account, the amount of margin (that $1,000) would still actually be able to support and make it possible for her to 'borrow' that extra $9,000 to do some leverage trading. The $1,000 in her account would serve as sufficient collateral for her to hit that $10,000 mark.

For example, if we assume that the price of bitcoin hits $11,000, and Alice had bought 1 bitcoin at $10,000, this would be a return of 10%, not too bad. But, if Alice had bought with leverage, let's say using a leverage ratio of 1:10, a price movement from $10,000 to $11,000 would yield a much greater percentage return of 1,000%.

Despite the enormous gains that could be made with leverage trading, it's important to understand that it can also be risky. Trades can go wrong, and in Alice's case, if the price of bitcoin fell to $9,000, Alice would have lost her entire $1,000 margin. This is known as being liquidated, and the price at which leveraged trades get liquidated will differ depending on the exchange. So, it's important to be familiar with the concept of liquidation before placing any leveraged trades.

The best crypto signals groups on Telegram use leveraged trading in a smart way that bring greater returns to their members.

### Best Crypto Signals: Cross and Isolated Margin

Now that you understand what leverage and margin are, it's time to introduce you to the concept of cross and isolated margin. As we have already mentioned, margin is simply the initial amount of money that needs to be held in your trading account to cover any possible losses that you might occur. But, these losses can be covered in different ways, and we will talk about 2 of those ways: cross margin and isolated margin.

Cross margin allows you to effectively use your entire account balance as collateral for leveraged trades. Whereas with isolated margin, it's just the initial margin in your trading account that you use that will be used to cover any losses. In other words, isolated margin means that the full amount of funds in your account is not used for any leveraged trades that you make.

### Best Crypto Signals: Going Long & Short

One of the key advantages of using leverage trading is that you will be able to go both long and short on any trades that you decide to enter. Regular spot trading would not allow you to take short positions, which is very limiting for a trader as you can only make money when the market moves upwards. This is not ideal, as the market obviously moves both up and down. Being able to trade both sides is preferable as there are more trading opportunities to take advantage of.

The best crypto signals group on Telegram will definitely be able to make money if bitcoin goes up or down. However, you can find some crypto signals groups that only take long trades or short trades.

Going long on a trade is very straightforward. It simply involves buying an asset low and then selling it for a higher price than which you bought it for. The difference between your buy and sell price is the profit that you will make.

Going short on a position is a little bit more different to going long. Going short involves borrowing an asset, for example bitcoin, from a willing lender that is then immediately sold at market price. If the price of the asset where to fall, then the asset is repurchased at a lower cost than which you sold it for, and the asset is returned to the lender. The difference between the price you sold for and then repurchased the asset is the profit that you will make on the short trade.

We are definitely seeing an uptick in the amount of traders that are turning to leverage trading, due to the opportunity to generate higher returns when compared to regular spot trading.

### Exchanges that allow Leverage Trading

Leverage trading in the crypto market is still a relatively new thing, so there aren't a lot of reputable cryptocurrency exchanges that offer leverage trading.

That being said, we do have our favorites, and by far the most popular exchanges that allow leverage trading are: Binance Futures and BitMEX.

### Binance Futures

We all know about Binance. They started off as a regular spot trading exchange and have now branched out into a numerous other things, and leverage trading is one of them. Binance created the Binance Futures platform, where users can enter into leveraged long and short positions.

![](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/interface-screenshot.png)

The Binance Futures interface is a pretty standard trading interface, with the key features being:

1. Users can choose which pair they would like to trade. The most traded pair is unsurprisingly the BTC/USDT pair. You can also decide how much leverage you would like to trade with. The Binance Futures default leverage is 20x, but you can go lower or all the way up to 125x leverage. Of course, you will also be able to choose if you would like to trade with cross and isolated margin.
2. This is the classic chart layout, where traders can switch between the price chart and the orderbook depth chart.
3. Here traders can also see a live graphic of the order book.
4. Live trades that are placed can be monitored in this section of the futures platform. This part of the interface includes a ton of useful information such as: margin balance, entry price and mark price.
5. By far the most important part of the interface is here, where traders will be able to place both long and short trades.

### How to get Started on Binance Futures

So, before you start leverage trading or receiving some of the best crypto signals in the space, you will have to first create a Binance Futures account. This is a very straightforward process that we will briefly walk you through now.

Firstly, you're going to need a regular Binance account before you can create a Binance Futures account. If you don't already have one, then visit the Binance.com webpage and click on 'Register' in the top corner of the page and create an account. You can also register on Binance using this link [here](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=36350940).

1. Enter your email address and password

![Registration Box](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2registerbox.png)

1. Click on 'create account'
2. You should then receive an email from Binance asking you to verify your registration. Go ahead and follow the steps in the email to activate your account.

Once that's done, or if you already had a Binance account, then you're going to want to go to the Binance homepage, and click on 'Trade' and then 'Futures'. This will get you started opening the Binance Futures trading account. We've also included an image below to help

### Funding a Binance Futures Account

Before you can start trading or following some of the best crypto signals we took a look at earlier in the article, you're going to have to fund your Binance Futures account. Here's how to do it.

On the Binance Futures platform, all cryptocurrencies will have a USDT trading pair, so you will need to have USDT in your Binance Futures account in order make trades on the futures platform.

One quick and easy way to get USDT into your Binance Futures wallet is to first transfer some USDT into your spot wallet (this is the USDT wallet connected to your regular Binance account). Once the USDT is in your spot wallet, it is very simple to get it into your Binance Futures wallet. To do this, click on 'Transfer' in the bottom right of the Binance Futures interface. You can then choose the amount of USDT you would like in your Binance Futures wallet. Once you're decided click 'Confirm transfer' and the funds will be added to your Binance Futures wallet.

![](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/transfer-from-sw-to-fw.png)

If you do not already have USDT in your spot wallet, you will have to deposit USDT into your spot wallet first and then go through the process we just described above. Getting USDT into your spot wallet is very straightforward, you can purchase some USDT using card or by a deposit. If you're still a bit confused, then this guide is a good explainer: [How to Deposit on Binance](https://www.binance.vision/tutorials/how-to-deposit).

### BitMEX

Another popular exchange that allows users to trade with leverage and enter both long and short positions is BitMEX.

BitMEX is a very reputable cryptocurrency exchange that has been operating in the community for a while now. With BitMEX you are trading what are known as contracts, instead of buying and selling actual cryptocurrency. These contracts are denominated in various cryptocurrencies, for example, a contract can be denominated in bitcoin.

The most traded/popular contract that is traded on BitMEX is known as the perpetual contract. At a basic level, perpetual contracts are a type of futures contracts. A futures contract is just an agreement to buy or sell a certain asset, for example crypto at a specified time in the future. BitMEX's perpetual contracts are a very special type of futures contract because they do not have an expiry date, meaning that they could theoretically be traded/held for an indefinite period of time.

Perpetual contracts are a type of derivative instrument, which just means that the value of a perpetual contract derive their value from something else, which would be cryptocurrency in this instance as it is the underlying asset underpinning the perpetual contracts on BitMEX.

For example, bitcoin would be the derivative asset that would underpin a bitcoin perpetual contract, and the value of the contract would derive from bitcoin. The ticker symbol for the bitcoin USD perpetual contract on BitMEX is known as'XBTUSD'.

There are a lot more contracts that BitMEX offers, for example:

* Ethereum (ETH)
* Cardano (ADA)
* Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
* Litecoin (LTC)

### How to get started on BitMEX

The set-up process for BitMEX is very similar to Binance Futures. Again, before you can start trading or receiving signals from some of the best crypto signals groups on Telegram, you're going to have to first create a BitMEX account. Once your account is open, simply deposit the cryptocurrency that you would like to trade and you can get started.

### Conclusion

The advantages of leverage trading are definitely obvious, and as a result it is becoming increasingly used among traders. This, combined with a reliable crypto signals group, can result in you being able to generate very consistent and reliable returns.

There are a wide variety of crypto signal groups to choose from, and we have introduced you to some of the best crypto signals groups that are currently out there. Make sure to do plenty of research before joining a group, and happy trading!
